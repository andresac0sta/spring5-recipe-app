Here we are going to start using the repository pattern

-- Recipe is going to be our primary object, and we will not be working ingredients or notes independently,
so we don't need a repository ingredients or notes.

--Category and unit of measure are going to be maintained independent of recipe.

--Create a package and name it repositories.

--the naming convention for repositories is using the domain or the entity  name follow by Repository

        CategoryRepository

--create the interfaces CategoryRepository, RecipeRepository, and the Repository

    public interface CategoryRepository extends CrudRepository<Category, Long> {
    }

--extend CrudRepository<T, ID> where T is the entity type and the ID is the
ID type of the entity =>CrudRepository<Category, Long>

   public interface CategoryRepository extends CrudRepository<Category, Long> {
    }
