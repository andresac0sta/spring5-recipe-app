Here we are going to use ENUMS stored in a DB

--Create an enum class Difficulty.java

--Now add the difficulty property to the Recipe.java class with setters and getters.
    @Enumerated(value = EnumType.STRING)
    private Difficulty difficulty;

--The EnumType can be set to ordinal or string, by default is set to ordinal.
--An ordinal Enum in the database will be a number e.g 1,2,3
--If you can always use EnumType.STRING which will persist the string  EASY, MODERATE, KIND_OF_HARD, HARD
