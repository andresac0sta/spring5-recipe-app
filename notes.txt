lecture 203 show ingredient
We are going to set up viewing a specific ingredient
Just as a helper we have IngredientCommand.java.
on line 16 we added a property for a recipeId so we know what recipe id this belongs to

We also implemented the method in the IngredientController.java

    @GetMapping
    @RequestMapping("recipe/{recipeId}/ingredient/{id}/show")
    public String showRecipeIngredient(@PathVariable String recipeId,
                                       @PathVariable String id, Model model){
        model.addAttribute("ingredient", ingredientService.findByRecipeIdAndIngredientId(Long.valueOf(recipeId), Long.valueOf(id)));
        return "recipe/ingredient/show";
    }

We also added the IngredientService.java

We also added the IngredientServiceImpl.java
